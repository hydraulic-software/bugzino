A `RoundedTextField` Jetpack Compose composable that builds on the Material Design `TextField` but changes the appearance to have a rounded rectangle outline with a small drop shadow around the edge to make it clearly defined. It has a clean, modern look. It takes a `Modifier` and also propagates the `singleLine` parameter.

When focused it should have a white background.
